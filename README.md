# Snakegame
Snake game made using python 3. This is the first game I have made using the pygame module and KiVy. It is an extremely rudimentary snake game, found on old mobile devices. The purpose and working of the game is simple: eat the food to increase your score and length, and you lose if you bang into any of the 4 surrounding boundaries.
